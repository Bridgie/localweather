# localweather
uses geolocation and openweather API to determine the weather in your home city

Local Weather was a project for FreeCodeCamp.come I used it to learn more about geolocation and connecting that information to an API
that would display the users local weather. Coded with Jquery and HTML&CSS

This application was developed for educational purposes. It was used to learn how to make applications with clean and good to read code.
Obviously I have not done the latter, This application serves a reminder to my mind of how much my coding skills have changed, I no longer
litter my code with useless variables and have since started commenting and cleaning up my code. The above reasons are why I am leaving
this application as it originally was developed, It is to show my learning curve from this to my present projects.
